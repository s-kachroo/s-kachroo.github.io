In my recent role as a Practicum Student Technical Lead at Volkswagen Group of America, I led the development of a scalable Digital Twin IDE, optimizing real-time data integration and reducing development time by 27%. Previously, as a Software Engineer Intern at The New York Times, I contributed to a native advertisement library, impacting 2M+ daily users and driving $104M+ in projected revenue.

During my tenure at Vymo Asia, I owned multiple features in a high-throughput production system used by 1M+ users, with responsibilities ranging from frontend and backend development to production deployments. I also tackled critical security vulnerabilities and contributed to a significant refactoring project, optimizing the system’s performance by 25%.
